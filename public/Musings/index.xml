      <description>States they killed Abu Muhammad al-Masri in November of 2001. Pg 262-70.
They really mean the military commander Abu Hafs al-Masri. (Atef)
“ [&amp;hellip;] On the night of November 15, 2001 coalition missiles hit the home of al-Qa&amp;rsquo;ida’s military chief, Abu Hafs al-Masri, crumpling it into a pile of stones at the bottom of a deep crater. While most al-Qa&amp;rsquo;ida commanders had evacuated, Abu Hafs had been unable to do so because of a slipped disk in his back.</description>

      <description>Alright I finally was able to setup Rblogdown with something resembling a type that I wanted. The biggest problem I had was the inability to figure out a decent workflow of things.

They have a bunch of different themes but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like very many of them and I have no html, css, javascript or bootstrap experience.</description>

      <description>Most people don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit. It&amp;rsquo;s out of sight, out of mind. There is also not much else to do besides monitoring if you are a civilian. Most people decry drone strikes without actual information and simply see it as an extrajudicial killing or assassination and go about their lives. There is a very specific type of outlet which actually monitors these strikes, and much of it is done on Twitter.</description>
