      <title>Nuclear Discussions Continued</title>

      <description>In the last post about these diplomatic talks, briefly mentioned was the Natanz blackout. The immediate sources claimed this was caused by a possible cyberattack by Israel.
Since then the nature of the attack is much clearer and it was in fact an explosion on 10 April 2021. This explosion targeted the internal power supply of the enrichment facility and the Nytimes quoted US intelligence sources, which claimed that this explosion set back enrichment efforts 9 months and had Israeli involvement.</description>

      <title>Iran Cyberattack</title>

      <description>Well that was quick.
Just after updating the current diplomatic &amp;ldquo;shuttle diplomacy&amp;rdquo; (dumb term in my opinion. Also indirect talks among others) going on in Vienna, this Sunday an electric blackout occurred at Natanz, Iran. Iran labeled this a terrorist attack and journalists are calling this a cyberattack.
Just yesterday Iran announced their use of 164 IR-6 centrifuges for uranium enrichment.
AP&amp;rsquo;s version here, Guardian here, and AFP here and here.</description>

      <description>For the past year or so I’ve been paying attention to this whole fiasco of nuclear grandstanding between the United States and Iran.
Basic preliminary instances that brought us to things today.
2018
•	8 MAY – United States withdraws from US led JCPOA nuclear agreement
•	NOVEMBER – Start of Maximum Pressure Campaign
2019
•	8 MAY – Iran officially announced abandoning some JCPOA elements.
•	20 JUNE – US drone shot down over Iranian airspace</description>

      <description>States they killed Abu Muhammad al-Masri in November of 2001. Pg 262-70.
They really mean the military commander Abu Hafs al-Masri. (Atef)
“ [&amp;hellip;] On the night of November 15, 2001 coalition missiles hit the home of al-Qa&amp;rsquo;ida’s military chief, Abu Hafs al-Masri, crumpling it into a pile of stones at the bottom of a deep crater. While most al-Qa&amp;rsquo;ida commanders had evacuated, Abu Hafs had been unable to do so because of a slipped disk in his back.</description>

      <title>How to View a Source</title>
      <link>https://osintelproject.org/daily-rundown/blog-8/</link>

      <description>Rules of Thumb: Every source is suspect. No source will ever be completely factually correct no matter who its author. A great deal of skepticism is needed when analyzing and evaluating new information.
What is the publishing history of the author of the source?
What is the motive to release or publish this source?
What platform is this source on?
Are the sources named or unnamed? What does the bibliography look like?</description>

      <title>First Sourcing Test</title>
      <link>https://osintelproject.org/daily-rundown/blog-7/</link>

      <description>This is a the first test to try and reference the article I am responding to. I never trust the article to be available or viewable to everyone because of paywalls. There are a number of options for doing this and from my opinion the best would be the markdown or pdf approach. Relying on archive.org is also possible but from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that sometimes can fall through so in all possibilities I will try to provide the source I am referencing in the markdown format and at the bottom of the article is the web url.</description>

      <title>Operation Lyautey</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found something of interest to my studies of counterinsurgency and this is somewhat tangentially related. So Hubert Lyautey is the father of French counter-insurgency doctrine and practice today. Very checkered history that depends implicitly on the reader&amp;rsquo;s biases for understanding his impact today. More than just &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; as critics of imperialism will no doubt designate him but had interesting ideas of small wars and intelligence. With him you have to take the bad before you attempt to use him for today.</description>

      <description>Alright this is a test to see what its like to write in word and then copy over to markdown. Note this isn’t an export.[1]

      <title>Iran&#39;s Drive for Bargaining Power</title>

      <description>Iran is reportedly enriching their uranium yields back to 20% to its prior negotiating level before the JCPOA deal brought back their levels to internally agreed upon numbers. Reuters picked this up as well as the source seems to be coming from the Russian envoy (Mikhail Ulyanov) to IAEA.
Now this information is interesting for a few reasons.
 Back in July 2019 it was reported that Iran was increasing its lowgrade stockpile and hedging its bets for Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election.</description>

      <description>Alright so this a new year and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to become much more accountable towards my daily writing endeavors.
I just finished Rajiv Chandrasekaran&amp;rsquo;s book Little America. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read his Life in the Emerald City about his reporting in Iraq. There are few reporters in my opinion that can do what he can and the importance of both of these two books will stand the test of time to later be used by historians in the ensuing years.</description>

      <description>So this year was a difficult year for all countries throughout the world dealing with covid and its socio-political implications. The issues in Ethiopia are much more complex than I can understand to any great degree. The one thing which is striking is how the international community view reformers to previous war-torn countries. They eat this shit up for breakfast. The new Ethiopian prime minister had a background in intelligence during the Eritrea-Ethiopian war.</description>

      <description>Alright I finally was able to setup Rblogdown with something resembling a type that I wanted. The biggest problem I had was the inability to figure out a decent workflow of things.
That&amp;rsquo;s the main way to get these things to all talk together. Here&amp;rsquo;s a helpful video tutorial of the setup. My biggest issue I had was with Hugo. They have a bunch of different themes but I didn&amp;rsquo;t like very many of them and I have no html, css, javascript or bootstrap experience.</description>

      <description>There is a new book out of on Qassam Soleimani by Arash Azizi. The Shadow Commander; Soleimani, the U.S., and Iran’s Global Ambitions I need to buy this and read it.
Found interview here by Carnegie

      <description>The hugo new theme command will scaffold the beginnings of a new theme for you to get you on your way.
If you’re creating a theme with plans to share it on the Hugo Themes website please note the following: - If using inline styles you will need to use absolute URLs, for the linked assets to be served properly, e.g. &amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;background: url(&#39;{{ &amp;quot;images/background.jpg&amp;quot; | absURL }}&#39;)&amp;quot;&amp;gt; - Make sure not to use a forward slash / in the beginning of a URL, because it will point to the host root.</description>

      <description>​ What is the most effective policy measures for preventing climate change? This singular question has been in the back of leaders&#39; minds ever since the first national UNFCC in 1992. By December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the market mechanism of cap-and-trade systems was conceived as the new pathway for reducing greenhouse gas emissions proposed by the United States. Since then, more national and subnational jurisdictions and private sector entities are adopting carbon pricing.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Drone Strikes</title>

      <description>Most people don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit. It&amp;rsquo;s out of sight, out of mind. There is also not much else to do besides monitoring if you are a civilian. Most people decry drone strikes without actual information and simply see it as an extrajudicial killing or assassination and go about their lives. There is a very specific type of outlet which actually monitors these strikes, and much of it is done on Twitter.</description>
