      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found something of interest to my studies of counterinsurgency and this is somewhat tangentially related. So Hubert Lyautey is the father of French counter-insurgency doctrine and practice today. Very checkered history that depends implicitly on the reader&amp;rsquo;s biases for understanding his impact today. More than just &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; as critics of imperialism will no doubt designate him but had interesting ideas of small wars and intelligence. With him you have to take the bad before you attempt to use him for today.</description>
