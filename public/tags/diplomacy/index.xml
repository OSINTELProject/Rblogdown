      <description>Hmm, what&amp;rsquo;s been going on over the past month or so?
Well, for the discussions not much has progressed over a continued belief of cautious optimism. There have been five rounds of discussions and this week there is a break before talks resume again.
Overall stance of both parties has not changed. US- Iran remove nuclear stockpile before sanctions lifted. Iran- US remove sanctions and then rejoin JCPOA.
There are a few notable events leading to this state of affairs.</description>
