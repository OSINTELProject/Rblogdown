      <description>Rules of Thumb: Every source is suspect. No source will ever be completely factually correct no matter who its author. A great deal of skepticism is needed when analyzing and evaluating new information.
What is the publishing history of the author of the source?
What is the motive to release or publish this source?
What platform is this source on?
Are the sources named or unnamed? What does the bibliography look like?</description>
