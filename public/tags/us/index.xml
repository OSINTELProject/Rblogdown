      <description>Interesting Iranian Op on US Soil
So a few days ago the US DOJ just released an indictment of 4 Iranian individuals who conspired to kidnap or coerce Masih Alinejad an American-Iranian human rights activist to come back to Iran. The DOJ press release can be found here and the Masih’s account of the issue via the UAE news site The National is here. First case to my knowledge of something like this happening on US soil against a US citizen.</description>

      <description>Hmm, what&amp;rsquo;s been going on over the past month or so?
Well, for the discussions not much has progressed over a continued belief of cautious optimism. There have been five rounds of discussions and this week there is a break before talks resume again.
Overall stance of both parties has not changed. US- Iran remove nuclear stockpile before sanctions lifted. Iran- US remove sanctions and then rejoin JCPOA.
There are a few notable events leading to this state of affairs.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Discussions Continued</title>

      <description>In the last post about these diplomatic talks, briefly mentioned was the Natanz blackout. The immediate sources claimed this was caused by a possible cyberattack by Israel.
Since then the nature of the attack is much clearer and it was in fact an explosion on 10 April 2021. This explosion targeted the internal power supply of the enrichment facility and the Nytimes quoted US intelligence sources, which claimed that this explosion set back enrichment efforts 9 months and had Israeli involvement.</description>

      <title>Iran Cyberattack</title>

      <description>Well that was quick.
Just after updating the current diplomatic &amp;ldquo;shuttle diplomacy&amp;rdquo; (dumb term in my opinion. Also indirect talks among others) going on in Vienna, this Sunday an electric blackout occurred at Natanz, Iran. Iran labeled this a terrorist attack and journalists are calling this a cyberattack.
Just yesterday Iran announced their use of 164 IR-6 centrifuges for uranium enrichment.
AP&amp;rsquo;s version here, Guardian here, and AFP here and here.</description>

      <description>For the past year or so I’ve been paying attention to this whole fiasco of nuclear grandstanding between the United States and Iran.
Basic preliminary instances that brought us to things today.
2018
•	8 MAY – United States withdraws from US led JCPOA nuclear agreement
•	NOVEMBER – Start of Maximum Pressure Campaign
2019
•	8 MAY – Iran officially announced abandoning some JCPOA elements.
•	20 JUNE – US drone shot down over Iranian airspace</description>
