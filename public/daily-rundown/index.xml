      <title>Iran Cyberattack</title>

      <description>Well that was quick.
Just after updating the current diplomatic &amp;ldquo;shuttle diplomacy&amp;rdquo; (dumb term in my opinion. Also indirect talks among others) going on in Vienna, this Sunday an electric blackout occurred at Natanz, Iran. Iran labeled this a terrorist attack and journalists are calling this a cyberattack.
Just yesterday Iran announced their use of 164 IR-6 centrifuges for uranium enrichment.

      <description>For the past year or so I’ve been paying attention to this whole fiasco of nuclear grandstanding between the United States and Iran.
Basic preliminary instances that brought us to things today.
2018
•	8 MAY – United States withdraws from US led JCPOA nuclear agreement
•	NOVEMBER – Start of Maximum Pressure Campaign
2019
•	8 MAY – Iran officially announced abandoning some JCPOA elements.
•	20 JUNE – US drone shot down over Iranian airspace</description>

      <title>How to View a Source</title>

      <description>Rules of Thumb: Every source is suspect. No source will ever be completely factually correct no matter who its author. A great deal of skepticism is needed when analyzing and evaluating new information.
What is the publishing history of the author of the source?
What is the motive to release or publish this source?
What platform is this source on?
Are the sources named or unnamed? What does the bibliography look like?</description>

      <title>First Sourcing Test</title>
      <link>https://osintelproject.org/daily-rundown/blog-7/</link>

      <description>This is a the first test to try and reference the article I am responding to. I never trust the article to be available or viewable to everyone because of paywalls. There are a number of options for doing this and from my opinion the best would be the markdown or pdf approach. Relying on archive.org is also possible but from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that sometimes can fall through so in all possibilities I will try to provide the source I am referencing in the markdown format and at the bottom of the article is the web url.</description>

      <title>Operation Lyautey</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found something of interest to my studies of counterinsurgency and this is somewhat tangentially related. So Hubert Lyautey is the father of French counter-insurgency doctrine and practice today. Very checkered history that depends implicitly on the reader&amp;rsquo;s biases for understanding his impact today. More than just &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; as critics of imperialism will no doubt designate him but had interesting ideas of small wars and intelligence. With him you have to take the bad before you attempt to use him for today.</description>

      <description>Alright this is a test to see what its like to write in word and then copy over to markdown. Note this isn’t an export.[1]

      <title>Iran&#39;s Drive for Bargaining Power</title>

      <description>Iran is reportedly enriching their uranium yields back to 20% to its prior negotiating level before the JCPOA deal brought back their levels to internally agreed upon numbers. Reuters picked this up as well as the source seems to be coming from the Russian envoy (Mikhail Ulyanov) to IAEA.
Now this information is interesting for a few reasons.
 Back in July 2019 it was reported that Iran was increasing its lowgrade stockpile and hedging its bets for Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election.</description>

      <title>Little America</title>

      <description>Alright so this a new year and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to become much more accountable towards my daily writing endeavors.
I just finished Rajiv Chandrasekaran&amp;rsquo;s book Little America. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read his Life in the Emerald City about his reporting in Iraq. There are few reporters in my opinion that can do what he can and the importance of both of these two books will stand the test of time to later be used by historians in the ensuing years.</description>

      <title>Ethiopian Tigray Insurgency</title>

      <description>So this year was a difficult year for all countries throughout the world dealing with covid and its socio-political implications. The issues in Ethiopia are much more complex than I can understand to any great degree. The one thing which is striking is how the international community view reformers to previous war-torn countries. They eat this shit up for breakfast. The new Ethiopian prime minister had a background in intelligence during the Eritrea-Ethiopian war.</description>
