      <description>Iran is reportedly enriching their uranium yields back to 20% to its prior negotiating level before the JCPOA deal brought back their levels to internally agreed upon numbers. Reuters picked this up as well as the source seems to be coming from the Russian envoy (Mikhail Ulyanov) to IAEA.
Now this information is interesting for a few reasons.
 Back in July 2019 it was reported that Iran was increasing its lowgrade stockpile and hedging its bets for Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election.</description>

      <description>Alright so this a new year and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to become much more accountable towards my daily writing endeavors.
I just finished Rajiv Chandrasekaran&amp;rsquo;s book Little America. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read his Life in the Emerald City about his reporting in Iraq. There are few reporters in my opinion that can do what he can and the importance of both of these two books will stand the test of time to later be used by historians in the ensuing years.</description>

      <description>So this year was a difficult year for all countries throughout the world dealing with covid and its socio-political implications. The issues in Ethiopia are much more complex than I can understand to any great degree. The one thing which is striking is how the international community view reformers to previous war-torn countries. They eat this shit up for breakfast. The new Ethiopian prime minister had a background in intelligence during the Eritrea-Ethiopian war.</description>
