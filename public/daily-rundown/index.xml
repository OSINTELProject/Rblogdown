      <description>Alright so this a new year and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to become much more accountable towards my daily writing endeavors.
I just finished Rajiv Chandrasekaran&amp;rsquo;s book Little America. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously read his Life in the Emerald City about his reporting in Iraq. There are few reporters in my opinion that can do what he can and the importance of both of these two books will stand the test of time to later be used by historians in the ensuing years.</description>

      <description>So this year was a difficult year for all countries throughout the world dealing with covid and its socio-political implications. The issues in Ethiopia are much more complex than I can understand to any great degree. The one thing which is striking is how the international community view reformers to previous war-torn countries. They eat this shit up for breakfast. The new Ethiopian prime minister had a background in intelligence during the Eritrea-Ethiopian war.</description>
