OSINTELProject was created to provide further context to global affairs. There are two gaps in OSINT reporting in my opinion, a good comprehensive list of trusted sources and a synthesis  of various sources into a specific topic. Currently this gap has been channeled to focus on recent JCPOA developments. 

This is a static site  [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium). [OSINTELProject](https://github.com/OSINTELProject/Rblogdown) then forked Yihui's theme to suit their own purposes.
