Hello and Happy New Year 

I thought it might be nice to welcome any visitors that somehow come across this site. I have not been trying to really promote this site for any wide readership but if you do happen to find this site that's great. Feel free to spread the word if so desired. 

## Daily Rundown

Since we are now in 2022 I thought it made sense to come up with a new goal for the 1 year anniversary of OSINTELProject. This past year I have continued to follow any new JCPOA developments. I still have not come to a clear conclusion if the daily rundown section should only conglemerate any new developments or if I should add my own two-sense on why these events matter. I think I will continue my imperfect approach of mostly gathering these sources and adding some small analysis when I believe its needed. Originally I had planned to monitor all top level geopolitical events but others can do this better (they have more time) as part of the rundown. I believe I can add some small value in focusing on the 1 issue and collecting articles about this. Since I have also added a Twitter handle, I will continue to tweet out any interesting articles I come across. 

## Book Reviews

This is where I will try to improve this section this year by adding my personal notes to things I have been reading along with a short review. Most of these books will focus on my personal research interests, but I figure making these available to all could help someone else, who knows. Think of it more as an open notebook and a much more informal review. The way I believe open source research should be done is by having a knowledge base seperate from the OSINT cybersecurity folks only worried about operational security or reading general Twitter chatter. (People worried about cyberattacks, zero day exploits, or background searches). The thing most people focus on is the most visible and neglect the proper continued background knowledge necessary to provide any helpful insight aside from pointing out the obvious. 

*Also my coding skills are neglibible and something I need to improve upon. 

So while of these books might not make sense in a traditional sense of OSINT these books will further my own approach to open source intelligence. If this helps you that's great, if not I'm sorry (feel free to send in any books you think I should review). 

## Long Form

My goal is to write 1 long article this year. I originally thought I would use this section to workshop some of my ideas from my  academic research but that goal has fallen off as of late. The goal this year is to write about what 100 years of air wars can teach us about the coming future of continued drone advacement. 

## New Section?

I am still puttering around with the idea of adding a new section. I think this one would be *Learning* and I'd try to focus on coding and data analysis skills. This is something I lack and hopefully can start to adress. OSINT works great with GIS and I frequently come across satellite imagery used to discuss international security stuff. This year I hope to dip my toes into this and begin expanding a more technical skill set. 

## Source List

I will be adding a source list I think on an online excel sheet. That way the sources I use can be used by anyone. 

I think this about wraps up my goals for this website for 2022.
