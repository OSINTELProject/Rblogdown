Alright I finally was able to setup Rblogdown with something resembling a type that I wanted. The biggest problem I had was the inability to figure out a decent workflow of things. 

<h1>
    RStudio>Hugo>Netlify
</h1>

That's the main way to get these things to all talk together. [Here's a helpful video tutorial of the setup.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jqvaoeh1W4) My biggest issue I had was with Hugo. They have a bunch of different themes but I didn't like very many of them and I have no html, css, javascript or bootstrap experience. So figuring out how to make things on the website resemble anything even close to what I envisioned was annoying. I ended up taking the maro theme and editing it. I've gotten it barebones to how I want it. Basically I wanted sections of topics of analysis and have all of them in their own /section/ on the website without all of them being put into a blog section. I had no idea that would be difficult. And just to archive this here's a screenshot of the main page right now. ![](C:\Users\ccerb\Documents\GitHub\Rblogdown\static\Musings\SiteScreenshot.jpeg)

Alright that's it for now this should be it for my first musings post.
