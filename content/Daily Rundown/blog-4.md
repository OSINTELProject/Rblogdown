Iran is reportedly enriching their uranium yields back to 20% to its prior negotiating level before the agreed Iran-US deal brought back their levels to internally agreed upon numbers.



Why would they do this? 

I can think of a few simple reasons. 

- Iran wants to renegotiate with the United States and do so from a position of strength. 
- The assassination of Soleimani has weakened their backing of Shia militias.
