## JCPOA

### 1. Not a great week by all accounts

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Global media coverage of the first week has not been altogether positive. Diplomats reconvened yesterday 11/12/2021 for a resumption of talks, <u>[largely at the behest of China and Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/iran-nuclear-deal-pulled-back-from-brink-of-collapse-as-talks-resume-in-vienna)</u>. 

### 2. More US military and Israeli aggressive proclamations

## Yemen Follow Up

The Sana'a Center has updated its Yemen Review publication with an update on the current Mar'ib offensive.[^1] From the looks of things the Saudi coalition has continued to be pushed back despite an earlier claim of killing aprox 200 enemy fighters.
