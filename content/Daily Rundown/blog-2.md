So this year was a difficult year for all countries throughout the world dealing with covid and its socio-political implications. The issues in Ethiopia are much more [complex](https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/01/the-nobel-peace-prize-winner-going-to-war-in-ethiopia-podcast "see this podcast embeded here from the Guardian") than I can understand to any great degree. The one thing which is striking is how the international community view reformers to previous war-torn countries. They eat this shit up for breakfast. The new Ethiopian prime minister had a background in intelligence during the Eritrea-Ethiopian war. All it took for the World Bank and IMF and other notables to dub him the greatest hope for peace simply because he's following their prescriptive medicine for economic reforms. He even got the Nobel Peace Prize. Currently there is a heavy offensive going on in Northern Tigray and it doesn't look to be resolved anytime soon sadly. Many refugees have fled to Sudan.
