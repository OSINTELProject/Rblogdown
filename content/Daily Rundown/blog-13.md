 *Iraq Elections*

Iraq held its parliamentary elecStions on 10 October with Moqtada al-Sadr winning the largest bloc. ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FBfgqsiXIAIqYO4?format=png&name=900x900)

·     Notable for first general election since the Fall 2019 protests over corruption and lack of public services among others.

·     Election reforms passed on November 2020 created a new voting system called the: single non-transferable vote (SNTV). 

​				o  Hoped to reduce the role of parties and factions in government which 				favors individual candidates. 

·     Low voter turnout: around 34% of eligible voters participated. Official estimates of registered voters stand at around 41%.[[2\]](#_ftn2) 

Chatham House has a decent overview of the Iraqi election system found [here](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/10/iraqs-electoral-system).

*Syria*

Aside from Jordan reopening its border with Syria [this article]( https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/10/who-really-controls-the-syrian-economy-the-syrian-regime-or-its-loyal-businessmen/) about Assad being subject to wealthy businessmen because the government is still strapped for cash is interesting. I see too many things on Assad’s complete hold on the country now that power has been centralized within the regime bloc. 

​      Since Syria’s economy has been tied to Lebanon’s throughout the past 10 years in reliance to obtaining USD, the importance of the business elite has only increased over the past 2 years due to Lebanon’s economic crisis. 

Now with the consolidation of power by Assad its either get in line or leave with an unknown number migrating to Egypt. 

Another slightly [humorous article posted by Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv5kb/bashar-al-assads-playboy-cousin-ali-makhlouf-spotted-driving-dollar300k-ferrari-in-beverly-hills) about Assad’s cousin riding around with an Israeli actress in LA. 

And I figured I’d add the news about Assad’s uncle coming back to Syria to escape jail time in France.[[3\]](#_ftn3)
