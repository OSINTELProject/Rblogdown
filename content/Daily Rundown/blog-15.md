## Turkey's Inflation Nonsense

ErdoÄŸan has sacked [3 central bank managers in the past 2.5 years](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/erdogans-drive-cut-turkish-interest-rates-2021-12-01/) and has continued to politicize Turkey's central bank which is a huge no-no in macro economic circles. Basically Erdogan wants to maintain low interest rates to stimulate Turkey's economy and attract foreign businesses but the lira's value keeps tumbling to new lows. 

I've been asking myeslf why this policy and the best thing I've come across was this by Carnegie.[^1]
