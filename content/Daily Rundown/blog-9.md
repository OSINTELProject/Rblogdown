Well that was quick. 

Just after updating the current diplomatic "shuttle diplomacy" (dumb term in my opinion. Also indirect talks among others) going on in Vienna, this Sunday an electric blackout occurred at Natanz, Iran. Iran labeled this a terrorist attack and journalists are calling this a cyberattack. 

Just yesterday Iran announced their use of 164 IR-6 centrifuges for uranium enrichment.

Basically the big question is was this an Israeli cyber op to torpedo any talks at Vienna for nuclear diplomacy. 

Interestingly the US Sec of Def Lloyd Austin, visited Israel this weekend pledging continued commitment to Israel's defense. [DoD official press release here](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/2568144/austin-says-us-commitment-to-israel-remains-ironclad/). As well as [Reuters bit here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-austin-idUKKBN2BY05X). Definitely must have had prior warning to what is currently referred to as a cyberattack. 

Main takeaway is this will shift back to Iran's hardline position of all sanctions removed at once. Harder to negotiate with that since Biden wants a gradual lift to ensure Iranian good behavior.
