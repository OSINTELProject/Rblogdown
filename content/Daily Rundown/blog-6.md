This is a the first test to try and reference the article I am responding to. I never trust the article to be available or viewable to everyone because of [paywalls](https://hackmd.io/@cZWTACDrRsWhBCNPdgmfOQ/SJ0T3lzku). There are a number of options for doing this and from my opinion the best would be the markdown or pdf approach. Relying on archive.org is also possible but from what I've seen that sometimes can fall through so in all possibilities I will try to provide the source I am referencing in the markdown format and at the bottom of the article is the web url. If my handy md-clipper extension fails to properly render the article, then I will try and link the pdf article.
